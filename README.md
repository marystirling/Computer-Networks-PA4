# Computer-Networks-PA4

For this assignement, we are measuring the computing the shortest path using Dikstra's algorithm for two computation methods: (1) hop count and (2) smallest delay. 

For the worker nodes, the following containers are placed:

  CompNW-worker1: msb_router1 

  CompNW-worker2: msb_router2  
  
  CompNW-worker3: msb_router3  
  
  CompNW-worker4: msb_router4 
  
  CompNW-worker5: msb_router5 
  
  CompNW-worker6: msb_client 
  
  CompNW-worker7: msb_server
